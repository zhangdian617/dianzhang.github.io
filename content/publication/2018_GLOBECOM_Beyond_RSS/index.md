abstract: Nowadays transceiver-free (also referred as Device- free) localization by using Radio Signal Strength (RSS) is a hot topic for researchers due to its wide applicability. But RSS is easily affected by indoor environment, resulting in dense deployment of reference nodes. Some hybrid systems have already been proposed to help RSS localization, but most of them require additional hardware support. In order to solve this problem, in this paper, we propose two algorithms, which leverage Packet Received Rate (PRR) to help RSS localization without additional hardware support. Specifically, when reference nodes are sparsely deployed and RSS is very weak, our approach is able to accurately localize the target. Based on sparsely wireless sensor network, the experiment results show that the localization accuracy of our approach outperforms the pure RSS based approach by about 12.8%.
