abstract:Detecting object shape presents significant values to applications such as Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and surveillance. Traditional solutions usually deploy camera on site and apply image processing algorithms to obtain object shape. Wearable solutions require target to wear some devices, and apply machine learning algorithms to train and recognize object behaviors. The recent advances in Radio Frequency (RF) technology offer a device-free solution to detect object shape, however a number of research challenges exist. This paper presents RF-Eye, a novel RF-based system to detect object shape without training in indoor environments. We design and implement Linear Frequency Modulated baseband signal, making it suitable for detecting object shape. We also apply the narrow pulse signal reflections and Doppler Frequency Shift to detect the full image of object shape. We implement RF-Eye on a Universal Software Radio Peripheral device. Our experimental results show that RF-Eye achieves 100% successful rate, and it performance is reliable in complicated cases.
