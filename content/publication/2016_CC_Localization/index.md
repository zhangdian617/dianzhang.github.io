abstract: Transceiver-free object localization can localize target through using Radio Frequency (RF) technologies without carrying any device, which attracts many researchers' attentions. Most traditional technologies usually first deploy a number of reference nodes which are able to communicate with each other, then select only some wireless links, whose signals are affected the most by the transceiver-free target, to estimate the target position. However, such traditional technologies adopt an ideal model for the target, the other link information and environment interference behavior are not considered comprehensively. In order to overcome this drawback, we propose a method which is able to precisely estimate the transceiver-free target position. It not only can leverage more link information, but also take environmental interference into account. Two algorithms are proposed in our system, one is Best K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm, the other is Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm. Our experiments are based on TelosB sensor nodes and performed in different complex lab areas which have many different furniture and equipment. The experiment results show that the average localization error is round 1.1m. Compared with traditional methods, the localization accuracy is increased nearly two times.
